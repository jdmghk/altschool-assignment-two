    <h2>Welcome to My World</h2>

    <p>Hello! I'm an aspiring cloud engineer passionate about creating amazing digital experiences.My name is Jacinth David. I am a 23 year old graduate of Covenant University where studied Electrical Electronics Engineering.I was born on March 28, 2001, emerging as the firstborn of four siblings, a position that has shaped my leadership skills and creative drive from an early age. Growing up in a bustling household, I quickly learned the art of self-expression, finding my voice through various artistic mediums. My passion for creation manifested initially through drawing and sketching, but it wasn't until I discovered 2D animation that I truly found my calling.My journey in animation began as a hobby during my teenage years, experimenting with simple software and creating short clips that caught the attention of friends and family. As I honed my skills, my unique style began to emerge â€“ a blend of vibrant colors, fluid movements, and storytelling that spoke to my Nigerian heritage and contemporary influences. This dedication to my craft eventually led to collaborations with notable figures in the Nigerian music and entertainment industry. My work with Victony, known for his Afro-fusion sound, involved creating animated music videos that perfectly captured the essence of his music.<br>
